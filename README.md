![Date Helper Mascot](/assets/mascot.jpg?raw=true "Date Helper Mascot")

Just some helpers for Date; JSON & Argonaut instances.

Not sure if I even needed to create this. Though, I couldn't find anything out there with these instances.

Modeled after & code re-used from something parsonsmatt wrote.
